            <h2>Why</h2>
            <h3>Why is Christmas my favorite holiday?</h3>
            <p>
              There is simply nothing that compares to the heart-warming, fuzzy
              feeling of the Christmas season. It’s a complete sensory delight,
              starting with the sheer joy of the festivities that sparkle all
              around us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine sinking into a favorite chair, bundled snuggly under a
              soft blanket, embracing that wonderfully cozy, warm feeling while
              the wind whispers outside. It’s the perfect setting for those
              delightful, and yes, sometimes wonderfully cringey-worthy romantic
              or comedy Christmas movies—they just add to the comfort every
              single year!
            </p>
            <p>
              And then there are the treats! The chance to try all those
              scrumptious seasonal pastries makes every day feel like a special
              indulgence. But the absolute best part, the true anchor of the
              holiday, is the quiet, precious time spent simply being together
              with family. It all comes together in an invitation of pure
              comfort and holiday cheer!

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Jenny, and I'm delighted to share that my heart truly
              belongs to the holiday season, especially the unparalleled magic
              of Christmas time. It's an open invitation to cozy warmth: the
              gentle hush of snow days, the comforting ritual of a perfect cup
              of hot chocolate, the deep joy of gift-giving, and that
              incomparable festive atmosphere that wraps us all in cheer. While
              I happily watch my cherished Christmas movies year-round, there's
              nothing quite as wonderful as sinking into them when the actual
              season is here.
