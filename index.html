            <h2>Why</h2>
            <h3>Why is Christmas my favorite holiday?</h3>
            <p>
              There is simply nothing that compares to the heart-warming, fuzzy
              feeling of the Christmas season. It’s a complete sensory delight,
              starting with the sheer joy of the festivities that sparkle all
              around us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine sinking into a favorite chair, bundled snuggly under a
              soft blanket, embracing that wonderfully cozy, warm feeling while
              the wind whispers outside. It’s the perfect setting for those
              delightful, and yes, sometimes wonderfully cringey-worthy romantic
              or comedy Christmas movies—they just add to the comfort every
              single year!
            </p>
            <p>
              And then there are the treats! The chance to try all those
              scrumptious seasonal pastries makes every day feel like a special
              indulgence. But the absolute best part, the true anchor of the
              holiday, is the quiet, precious time spent simply being together
              with family. It all comes together in an invitation of pure
              comfort and holiday cheer!

                <!-- Movie 1 -->
                <h4>Elf</h4>
                <p>
                  Stars Will Ferrell as Buddy, a human raised by Santa's elves
                  in the North Pole. Upon learning he is human, the endearingly
                  naive Buddy travels to New York City in his green elf costume
                  to find his cynical biological father. His childlike wonder
                  and relentless enthusiasm for all things Christmas hilariously
                  clash with the fast-paced, skeptical human world. This beloved
                  holiday comedy is a sweet story about family, embracing your
                  true self, and spreading Christmas cheer by simply believing.
                </p>

                <h5>What I like about it?</h5>
                <p>
                  I adore Elf for the comedy, especially Will Ferrell's
                  brilliant portrayal of Buddy's childlike wonder exploring New
                  York City for the first time. The genuine, often bewildered,
                  reactions of the everyday New Yorkers visible in the
                  background shots truly amplify the humor and make the movie an
                  absolute delight.

                <h4>Klaus</h4>
                <p>
                  A beautifully animated origin story that provides a
                  heartwarming, non-traditional take on the Santa Claus legend.
                  The film follows Jesper, a spoiled postman assigned to the
                  frozen town of Smeerenburg, where he reluctantly partners with
                  a reclusive, burly woodsman named Klaus to deliver toys. Their
                  efforts to bring joy to the feuding villagers accidentally
                  spark a cycle of selfless giving and kindness. The movie’s
                  unique, hand-drawn aesthetic and sincere message about how "a
                  true act of goodwill always sparks another" make it an instant
                  modern classic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Klaus is truly a treasure because of its deep, heartwarming
                  core. The entire film just wraps you up in a beautiful
                  feeling, perfectly illustrating how the cherished Christmas
                  tradition of giving so sweetly sparks another ripple of
                  kindness and love throughout the world. It’s a gentle reminder
                  of the season's genuine generosity.

                <h4>Santa Clause</h4>
                <p>
                  The Santa Clause film series begins with Tim Allen as Scott
                  Calvin, an ordinary father who accidentally causes Santa Claus
                  to fall off his roof and is magically forced to take his
                  place. This hilarious premise follows Scott's gradual,
                  bewildered transformation into the jolly old elf, complete
                  with a growing beard and belly. Across the subsequent films,
                  the series explores the North Pole's inner workings, the
                  challenges of balancing Santa's life with family, and the
                  importance of maintaining belief. It's a comforting,
                  fun-filled franchise that delivers a playful, modern take on
                  the mythology of Santa Claus.
                </p>
                <h5>Release</h5>
                <p>November 1, 1994</p>
                <h5>What I like about it?</h5>
                <p>
                  The Santa Clause series is its warm, magical comedy starting
                  with Tim Allen's character hilariously becoming Santa after a
                  fateful roof incident. Watching Scott Calvin's journey of
                  learning to accept his new role, with the sweet help of
                  Charlie, is truly heartwarming. The best part is that the film
                  continuations consistently carry forward that same delightful
                  message of belief and acceptance.

              My name is Jenny, and I'm delighted to share that my heart truly
              belongs to the holiday season, especially the unparalleled magic
              of Christmas time. It's an open invitation to cozy warmth: the
              gentle hush of snow days, the comforting ritual of a perfect cup
              of hot chocolate, the deep joy of gift-giving, and that
              incomparable festive atmosphere that wraps us all in cheer. While
              I happily watch my cherished Christmas movies year-round, there's
              nothing quite as wonderful as sinking into them when the actual
              season is here.
